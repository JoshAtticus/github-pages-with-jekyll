So, I've been a bit bored lately, I occasionally get a notification from Github, and email to read or a ping on Matrix, buuut that's not very often
and I've been wanting something to read or do in my free time. If you have a suggestion, feel free to <a href="mailto:2je0l39dv@mozmail.com">This totally anonymous email address from firefox relay</a>
 or just message me on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/OSMANiCTeam/comments">Scratch</a>.
 
 So uh, yeah, bye?
