Sooo, yeah.
Recently, I got this Acer Aspire E5, and I was really hoping to install <b>Zorin OS 16 Core</b>, except... everything went wrong.
Alright, so just to get this straight, the laptop was not going to be for me, it would be for my brother, as he REALLY wanted to play Civilization 6 on Steam.
I already knew linux would work best, so I decided to use the same OS as my main PC, I thought everything would go perfectly, oh I was wrong.

So, I go ahead, I make the USB drive, and boot up the laptop. I run the installation, but I place /home on the 1TB HDD and everything else on the 128GB SSD.
The installation completes, and I reboot, I was told that I would get instructions to configure secure boot, but nothing, it just told me to remove the USB
and press enter, which I did.

# No bootable device
Oh my goodness, what went wrong? Ugh, I guess i'll just put everything on the HDD. Still no luck, I tried reinstalling with no secure boot, legacy bios mode,
I tried everything! I couldn't boot into a live disk anymore, not even boot repair.

# So what did I do?
I gave up.
Yes I reinstalled Windows, and I hate myself for it.
